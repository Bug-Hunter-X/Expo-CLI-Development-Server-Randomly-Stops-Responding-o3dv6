While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly stop responding, requiring a manual restart.  This wasn't tied to any specific code change or action within my application. The error logs provided no specific clues, only showing the server becoming unresponsive.  This happened intermittently across different projects and Expo versions.
