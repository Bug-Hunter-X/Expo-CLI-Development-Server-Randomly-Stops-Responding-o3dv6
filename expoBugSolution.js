Several steps can be taken to address this issue, though a definitive fix is not always guaranteed.  The approach should be systematic:

1. **Clear the Expo cache:** This is often the first solution.  In your terminal, run `expo start --clear` or navigate to your project's `.expo` directory and delete it before restarting the server.
2. **Restart your machine:** A simple restart is surprisingly effective in resolving various software glitches. 
3. **Check for port conflicts:** Ensure no other application is using the port Expo's development server attempts to use (usually 19000 or 19001).  You can use the `netstat -a -b` command (Windows) or `lsof -i -P -n` (macOS/Linux) to check for active ports. 
4. **Check system resource usage:** High CPU, memory, or disk usage can lead to development server instability.  Monitor these resources. 
5. **Check for conflicting processes:**  Occasionally, other processes could conflict with the Expo server.  Review running processes for potential interference. 
6. **Update Expo CLI:**  Ensure your Expo CLI is up-to-date using `npm install -g expo-cli` or `yarn global add expo-cli`.
7. **Create a new project:** If the above steps are ineffective, creating a fresh Expo project can help rule out potential project-specific configuration issues.
